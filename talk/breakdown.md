Primary goals of the project

* Bring existing PHP code to the Java world
* Allow step-by-step conversion
* Give the developers a clean starting point to begin refactoring
  * At this point the code should be as typesafe as possible
  

Unluckily PHP is not a language the allows an easy transformation.

* [The many influences of PHP](php_influences.html)
  * Problems you might encounter when just trying copy&paste "transformation"
  * What's going on under the hood
* [General project structure](project_structure.html)
